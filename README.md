# Genius Piece Boards
## Last updated 9 August 2020

This repository contains the source code for Genius Piece Boards, a 4chan-esque application originally created as my final project for CS50 2020. The program is written primarily in Python using Flask, as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. It is very basic but contains all the fundamental features of an imageboard. I hope to expand on it in the future but for now I am satisfied with it in its current state.
