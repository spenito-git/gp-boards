# Genius Piece Boards
## Last updated 9 August 2020

his repository contains the source code for Genius Piece Boards, a 4chan-esque application originally created as my final project for CS50 2020. The program is written primarily in Python using Flask, as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. It is very basic but contains all the fundamental features of an imageboard. I hope to expand on it in the future but for now I am satisfied with it in its current state.

# Local setup

If you wish to run this app locally in order to test and/or modify for your own usage, first ensure that you have Python 3.8 installed as well as Flask, either via pip or your system's package manager. In the project's root directory, run `export FLASK_APP=application.py` or whatever your system's equivalent command is and then simply `flask run` to start the application, which will be accessible at 127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.
